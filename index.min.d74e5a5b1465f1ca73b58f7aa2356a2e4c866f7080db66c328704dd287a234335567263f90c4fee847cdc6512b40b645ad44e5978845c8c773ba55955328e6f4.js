The field ServerAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which the client will request a response from the server if no data has been received recently. The field ServerAliveCountMax sets the number of server alive messages which may be sent to the server without receiving any reply before ssh disconnects from the server. The field ForwardX11 specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected over the secure channel of the ssh connection. The field ForwardX11Trusted specifies whether remote X11 clients are given full access to the original X11 display The field ForwardAgent specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any) is forwarded to the remote machine.
