## Creating an SSH key pair

An SSH key pair secures can be used as an additional layer of security to connect
to your account on the CCB HPC cluster.
Instead of typing your username and password, you log into the CCB HPC cluster using
a pair of files - one file on your personal computer, one file on the cluster -
which identify your personal computer and the cluster to each other.

To create the SSH key pair, open a Terminal on your personal computer, and type:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

When prompted for a filename, immediately press the Return key to accept the default filename.

When prompted for a passphrase, it is recommended to type a password that is
secret yet memorable to you, as this will be the last line of defense if your
someone gained access to your private SSH key file.
Alternatively, you can press the Return key immediately without entering a passphrase,
leaving your SSH key pair unprotected.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="For privacy and security reasons, the Terminal will not display your passphrase as you type it." />}}

When prompted to confirm your passphrase, type the same answer as you just did and press the Return key.

Finally, the Terminal should display a message indicating that the key pair was successfully created.
