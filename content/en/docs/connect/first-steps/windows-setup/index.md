## Install Git Bash for Windows

### Motivation

Microsoft Windows does not have a built-in Terminal emulator
(The MS Windows Command Prompt `cmd.exe` is a command-line interpreter 
that does not include many of the commands needed to connect to
the CCB cluster).

The primary function of the Git Bash for Windows program is to provide
a Bash emulation used to run Git from the command line.
Conveniently, in its effort to offer that functionality,
the Terminal emulator of Git Bash for Windows also includes
all the commands that you will need to connect to the CCB cluster.

### Download the installer file

In your web browser, navigate to <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.

In the 'Downloads' section, click on 'Windows'.
