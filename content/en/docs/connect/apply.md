## Get started

Apply for an account on the [CCB Account and Support â†’][ccb-account-support] page.

### Full account

A full account gives access to all of our base resources, including free admission
to all CCB introductory bioinformatics training courses.

  **Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research** (LICR) and
  **Department of Biochemistry** pay a service charge to help fund the CCB
  and there are no additional charges.
- **Other Departments** - Accounts cost Â£1000 and are invoiced annually.

Apply for or renew your full CCB Account [here â†’][request-an-account].

### Imaging account

Apply for or renew your Imaging Account [here â†’][request-an-account].

## Funding your account

CCB accounts are subject to charging as a result of the costs associated with the necessary storage and computing facilities. Most funding bodies accept this as a justifiable cost and we encourage all users to include these charges in their grant requests.
