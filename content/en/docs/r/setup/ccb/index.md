## Overview

As well as the standard R versions that you would normally expect, the CCB team
additionally preinstalled hundreds of additional packages available for all to
use. These are available via the `R-cbrg` module.

## Basic usage

If you just want to get up and running with set of commonly used bioinformatics
packages curated by the CCB team, you can do so with a single command:

```bash
module load R-cbrg
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The RStudio application is a separate module called 'rstudio'." />}}

## Request additional packages

If you need to use a package which is not already installed, please contact the
CCB team via the address below before attempting to install a local copy. In
many cases the CCB team can easily add it to the central installation.

## Advanced usage

The setup of the `R-cbrg` module uses the following system.

The `R-base` module contains fixed, unchanging installations of the base
language. This is for safety â€“- they cannot be accidentally overwritten causing
unexpected changes of behaviour. The module `R-cbrg` contain separate package
and library repositories for each version of Python. Because packages and
library versions also change over time, we take a snapshot of the state on a
monthly basis and then lock this to prevent changes causing unexpected
behaviour. A single current version for each provides a continual rolling 'head'
where changes are applied. Loading the `R-cbrg` module will automatically pull
in the latest stable base and all packages or libraries.

For instance:

```txt
module load R-cbrg
module list
```

However, if you want to use a different version of the base, you can do that by
loading it manually first:

```bash
module load R-base/3.6.3
module load R-cbrg
module list
```

Simmilarly, if you want to use a different version of the libraries, for example
because a recent update broke something you relied on, you can do that by
loading it manually:

```bash
module load R-cbrg/202108
module list
```
