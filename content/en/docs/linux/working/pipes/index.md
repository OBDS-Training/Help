## What is the Linux pipe?

The Linux philosophy is that one tool should only perform only one task,
in a way that complex workflows may be broken down into smaller tasks that
can be resolved by combining multiple tools.

The Linux pipe is represented by the symbol `|` and provides a tool connecting
the standard output of one command to the standard input of another command.

For instance, the standard output of a command `command1` can be passed to
the standard input of a command `command2` using the sytanx 
`command1 | command2`.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The Linux pipe is read from left to right. The standard output of the command on the left is passed to the standard input of the command on the right." />}}

For instance:

```bash
cat file1.txt | head -n 5
```
