## Motivation

Sets of commands can be enclosed in programmatical loops,
that are repeated until all inputs are processed or a certain condition is met.

## The for loop

The `for` loop takes a list of inputs, and iterates over each item in the list,
repeating a set of commands -- once for each input -- until all inputs are processed.

### Integer over fixed inputs

The `for` loop can be given a list of inputs to iterate over as a space-separated
array of values.

For instance:

```bash
for i in 2 5 3
do
  echo "start"
  echo "value of i: '$i'"
  echo "end"
done
```

In particular:

- The operator `for` declares the start of the loop definition.
- The (arbitrary) variable name `i` is declared as the iterator that will take a different
  value during each iteration.
- The values to iterate over are given as a space-separated list.
- The operator `do` declares the start of the set of commands to execute during each
  iteration of the loop.
- A series of commands print messages in the Terminal.
  In this example, the first and third messages remain the same for each iteration,
  while the second message dynamically uses the value of the iterator for each specific
  iteration.
  The commands are indented only for visual effect; this is not necessary, but it generally
  improves the readability of Bash scripts.
- The operator `done` declares the end of the set of commands to execute during each
  iteration of the loop.

### Iterate over integer values

The curly braces `{}` and the `seq` command can be used to rapidly generate 
regular sequences of integer values to iterate over.

The syntax `{start..end}` can be used to generate a sequence of integers
from `start` to `end` in increments of 1.

The example below illustrate how this syntax can be used to iterate over the
integers from 1 to 3 by increments of 1.

```bash
for i in {1..3}
do
  echo "value of i: '$i'"
done
```

Furthermore, the extended syntax `{start..end..increment}` can be used to control the
increment to use.

The example below illustrate how this syntax can be used to iterate over the
integers 1 to 7 by increments of 2.

```bash
for i in {1..7..2}
do
  echo "value of i: '$i'"
done
```

Similarly, the `seq` command can be used to the same effect.

The example below iterates over the integer values from 1 to 3 by increments of 1.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 3)
do
  echo "value of i: '$i'"
done
```

The example below iterates over the integer values from 1 to 7 by increments of 2.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 2 7)
do
  echo "value of i: '$i'"
done
```

## The while loop

The `while` loop takes a conditional statement, and repeats a set of commands
indefinitely while the statement remains true.
The loops terminates only when the statement is false at end of an iteration.
