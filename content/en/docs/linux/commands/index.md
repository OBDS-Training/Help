## Overview

This page is broadly arranged from completely safe command that purely display information,
to more advanced commands that modify files, directories, and the session environment.

## man

The `man <page>` command can be used to print the reference manual page `<page>`.

For instance, the reference manual page for the command `pwd` can be displayed as follows:

```bash
man pwd
```

![Manual page for the 'pwd' command.](man-pwd.png)

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The manual page is open in an interactive viewer in the Terminal application. To close that interactive viewer, press the `Q` key." />}}

Incidentally, the reference manual page for the command `pwd` is opened as follows:

```bash
man man
```

The ability to access, read, and understand manual pages is one of the first essential skills
to develop as a Bash user.
A lot of information and advice on Bash commands, tips and tricks, is available throughout the Internet.
However, the manual pages accessed through the `man` command correspond to the current version
of each command available on the CCB cluster, and should be considered as the reference above any
other source of information.

## type

The `type <name>` command can be used to identify how `<name>` would be interpreted
if used as a command.

```bash
type pwd
type less
```

Identifying commands that are Bash built-in or additional command from third-party
software can be helpful to understand and investigate bugs and unexpected
behaviours.

## which

The `which <program>` command can be used to display the full path to the
command `<program>`.

```bash
which man
```

## pwd

The working directory is the directory where the Bash session is currently
located, and relative to which commands typed in a Terminal are executed.

The `pwd` command prints the current working directory.

```bash
pwd
```

When you log into the CCB cluster, the working directory is initially set to
the user's home directory.

## ls

Listing the contents of directories is essential to identify files that are
available for use, as well as directories that can be navigated into.

The `ls` command prints the list of files in a given directory.

Alone, the `ls` command prints the list of files and directories in the
working directory.

```bash
ls
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Colors are used to indicate the type of each file (directory: dark blue; file: black; symbolic link: light blue)." />}}

Given the path to an existing directory, the `ls` command prints the list of
files in that particular directory.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The directory path can be absolute or relative to the working directory." />}}

```bash
ls /       # absolute path (starts with '/')
ls ~/.ssh  # relative path  (does not start with '/')
```

The `ls` command also accepts a number of options.
Most commonly, the `-l` option is used to display detailed information about
each file, including permissions, file size, and the timestamp of the latest
update to each file.

```bash
ls -l
```

![Listing file and directories with detailed information.](ls-l.png)

Often, the `-h` option is added to display file sizes in human-readable format,
adding units (e.g., K - kilobyte, M - megabyte, G - gigabyte).
Multiple options can be combined under the same `-` symbol.
The two forms below are equivalent.

```bash
ls -lh
ls -l -h
```

![Listing file and directories with file size in human-readable units.](ls-lh.png)

The `-t` option can be used in combination with the `-l` option to sort files
by modification time (newest first).

```bash
ls -lt
```

![Listing file and directories from the most recently edited to the least recently edited.](ls-lt.png)

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The timestamp indicating the more recent edit to each file is displayed as the field directly on the left on each filename." />}}

The `-a` option can be used to reveal and include hidden files and directories.

```bash
ls -a
```

![Listing hidden files and directories.](ls-a.png)

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Hidden files and directories have a name that start with the '.' symbol, e.g. '.ssh'." />}}

Finally -- to clarify -- options and paths can be combined, to list the contents
of a particular directory with specific options.

```bash
ls -ltah ~/.ssh
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The 'ls' command is entirely harmless. Do not hesitate to experiment and get comfortable with it!" />}}

## cd

Changing the working directory is often essential to run commands in the
appropriate working directory.

Given the path to an existing directory, the `cd` command changes the working directory to
that directory.

```bash
cd /       # absolute path (starts with '/')
cd ~/.ssh  # relative path  (does not start with '/')
```

![Changing directory using a relative path.](cd-ccb_demo.png)

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The directory path can be absolute or relative to the current working directory." />}}

Alone, the `cd` command changes the working directory to the user's home directory.

```bash
cd
```

![Changing directory to the user home directory.](cd-home.png)

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Use the 'ls' command to identify existing directories that you give to the 'cd' command." />}}

The `..` shorthand refers to the parent directory of each directory on the system.
This can be used to move out of a directory.
The shorthand can be combined multiple times in the same path to move out multiple
levels at once.
Some examples are given below.

```bash
cd ..
cd ../..
cd ../../another_directory
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The 'cd' command is entirely harmless. Do not hesitate to experiment and get comfortable with it! Invalid 'cd' command will only display an error message and keep the working directory unchanged." />}}
