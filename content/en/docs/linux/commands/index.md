## Motivation

Once logged into the CCB cluster, commands typed in a Terminal application
are run in a Bash environment.

Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system.
The Bash interpreter includes a number of built-in commands that allow users to
navigate and manage directories and files on the CCB cluster.

In this page, we provide a cheatsheet of the most commonly used commands
along with a brief description of their purpose and advice on best practices.

## pwd

The working directory is the directory relative to which commands typed in a
Terminal are executed.

The `pwd` command prints the current working directory.

```bash
pwd
```

When you log into the CCB cluster, the working directory is initially set to
the user's home directory.

## ls

Listing the contents of directories is essential to identify files that are
available for use, as well as directories that can be navigated into.

The `ls` command prints the list of files in a given directory.

Alone, the `ls` command prints the list of files in the working directory.

```bash
ls
```

Given the path to an existing directory, the `ls` command prints the list of
files in that particular directory.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The directory path can be absolute or relative to the working directory." />}}

```bash
ls /       # absolute path (starts with '/')
ls ~/.ssh  # relative path  (does not start with '/')
```

The `ls` command also accepts a number of options.
Most commonly, the `-l` option is used to display detailed information about
each file, including permissions, file size, and the timestamp of the latest
update to each file.

```bash
ls -l
```

Often, the `-h` option is added to display file sizes in human-readable format,
adding units (e.g., K - kilobyte, M - megabyte, G - gigabyte).
Multiple options can be combined under the same `-` symbol.
The two forms below are equivalent.

```bash
ls -lh
ls -l -h
```

The `-t` option can be used in combination with the `-l` option to sort files
by modification time (newest first).

```bash
ls -lt
```

The `-a` option can be used to reveal and include hidden files and directories.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Hidden files and directories have a name that start with the '.' symbol, e.g. '.ssh'." />}}

```bash
ls -a
```

Finally -- to clarify -- options and paths can be combined, to list the contents
of a particular directory with specific options.

```bash
ls -lh ~/.ssh
```

## cd

Changing the working directory is often essential to run commands in the
appropriate working directory.

Alone, the `cd` command changes the working directory to the user's home directory.

```bash
cd
```

Given the path to an existing directory, the `cd` command changes the working directory to
that directory.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The directory path can be absolute or relative to the current working directory." />}}

```bash
cd /       # absolute path (starts with '/')
cd ~/.ssh  # relative path  (does not start with '/')
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Use the 'ls' command to identify existing directories that you give to the 'cd' command." />}}

The `..` shorthand refers to the parent directory of each directory on the system.
This can be used to move out of a directory.
The shorthand can be combined multiple times in the same path to move out multiple
levels at once.
Some examples are given below.

```bash
cd ..
cd ../..
cd ../../another_directory
```
