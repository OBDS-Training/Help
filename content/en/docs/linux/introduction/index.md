## What is Bash?

Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system.
In other words, it is the programming language that is used to issue commands to the
operating system from the Terminal application.

## How do I use Bash?

If you have gone through the earlier section
[Connect to CCB]({{< relref "/docs/connect/" >}}),
then congratulations: you have been using Bash already!

Once logged into the CCB cluster, commands typed in a Terminal application
are run in a Bash environment.

From the moment you typed commands such as `ssh` and `passwd` in the Terminal
application, you have been working in a Bash session, and issuing commands
to the operating system from that Bash session.

## Where do I go from here?

Once connected to the CCB cluster, you can use built-in Bash commands to:

- list and navigate directories in the filesystem
- create, edit, remove, open and execute files
- create and remove directories
- ...and much more!

In the following pages, this documentation introduces commonly used built-in
Bash commands and options, and describing best practices on the CCB cluster.
