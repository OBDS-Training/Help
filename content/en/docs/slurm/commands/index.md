## Motivation

Once logged into the CCB cluster, a number of Slurm commands can be used to query
resources available and the current workload.

In this page, we provide a cheatsheet of the most commonly used commands
along with a brief description of their purpose and advice on best practices.

## Partitions

Summary information about partitions (i.e., job queues) can be accessed as follows.

```bash
sinfo
```

<p align='center'><i>Example output for the `sinfo` command.</i></p>

The `sinfo` command displays the name of partitions and additional information
in a customisable list of fields.
The full list of fields and their description can be found in the
[Slurm documentation â†’][sinfo-output-fields].

In particular:

* The asterisk symbol `*` indicates the default partition, to which jobs are submitted
  when users don't request a specific queue.
* The field `AVAIL` set to the value `up` indicates partitions that are accepting
  new jobs.
* The field `TIMELIMIT` indicates the maximum time limit allowed for jobs submitted
  to each partition (in the format hours:minutes:seconds).
  The value `infinite` is used to identify partitions without a job time limit.
* The field `NODES` indicates the number of nodes with each particular configuration
  in each partition.
* The field `STATE` indicates the state of nodes in each partition; for instance:
  * The value `alloc` indicates nodes allocated to one or more jobs.
  * The value `idle` indicates nodes that are not allocated to any job.
  * The value `mixed` indicates nodes where some CPUs are allocated a job
    while others are idle.
  * The value `drain` indicates nodes that are currently executing jobs,
    but do not accept new jobs, per administrator request
    (e.g., for maintenance).

## Nodes

The full list of individual nodes and associated information can be obtained as follows.

```bash
sinfo --Node --long
```

![Example output of the `sinfo --Node --long` command.](sinfo-node-long-screenshot.png)

<p align='center'><i>Example output of the `sinfo --Node --long` command.</i></p>

In particular:

* The `--Node` option reports a separate line for each node in each partition
  (a node can be shared by multiple partitions).
* The `--long` option reports more detailed information.

More detailed information about the configuration of each individual nodes
can be obtained as follows.

```bash
scontrol show node
```

The full list of nodes above may be excessive.
Information about a particular node can be obtained as follows.

```bash
scontrol show node <nodename>
```

Replace `<nodename>` by the name of the particular node.
