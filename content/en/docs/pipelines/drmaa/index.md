## Motivation

The [Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA) â†’][drmaa-org]
is used by workflow managers such as [cgatcore â†’][cgatcore-github]
to communicate with HPC queue managers while submitting and monitoring jobs.

The [drmaa][drmaa-python] package provides a Python interface to the
DRMAA library.

This page describes the setup necessary for using DRMAA on the CCB cluster.
This setup is a prerequisite for using [cgatcore â†’][cgatcore-github] pipelines.

## Setup

On the CCB cluster, in your `~/.bashrc` file, add the following chunk of code
to set the environment variable `DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH`.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="If your '.bashrc' file already contains the conditional statement 'if [[ $PS1 ]]', you can add only the 'export' statement within the existing bloc of code." />}}

```bash
if [[ $PS1 ]]; then
    export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/libdrmaa.so
fi
```

You are now ready to use the DRMAA library in [cgatcore â†’][cgatcore-github]
pipelines.
