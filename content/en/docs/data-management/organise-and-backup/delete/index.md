## Which files can be deleted?

Many bioinformatics workflows involve multiple steps of processing
on certain files (e.g., filtering, sorting, annotation).

Those steps generate and store multiple copies of those files
at the various steps of processing.

In such cases, you should consider deleting all but the final copy of
that file.

For instance:

```bash
# Run HISAT2 to map reads
hisat2 -f \
  -x $HISAT2_HOME/example/index/22_20-21M_snp \
  -U $HISAT2_HOME/example/reads/reads_1.fa \
  -S example1.sam
# Run samtools view to convert from SAM to BAM
samtools view -bS example1.sam > example1.bam
# Run samtools sort to sort mapped reads
samtools sort example1.bam -o example1.sorted.bam
# Remove intermediate files
rm example1.sam example1.bam
```

In particular:

- The `rm` command is used to delete all files except for the final `example1.sorted.bam`.

## Which files should not be deleted?

### Small files

It is usually unecessary to delete small intermediate files.

The benefit of disk space recovered is usually negligible against the time
and effort necessary to regenerate those files if necessary.
