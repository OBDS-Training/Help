## Case-sensitivity

In Linux, file names are case-sensitive.

In the example below, a series of distinct files stored in the same directory
differ only by the case-sensitivity of their filenames.

![Example of filenames that differ only by case-sensitive characters](case-sensitive.png)

## Unicity within directories

File names must be unique within each directory.

Bearing in mind the case-sensitivity of filenames described above,
all filenames within a given directory must be distinct.

For instance, using the `>` (greater than) symbol to redirect a stream
to a filename that already exists will overwrite that file
(i.e., it will not create another
file with the same name).

For instance, the code below will either:

- Create the file `file.txt` if it does not exist (and add `Hello` as its contents).
- Overwrite the contents of the file if it already exists.

```bash
echo "Hello" > file.txt
```

## Symbols allowed in filenames

Filenames can included a limited set of characters, including:

- Uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Digits.
- `-` (dash), `_` (underscore).

## Symbols to avoid in filenames

Some characters are not allowed or strongly discouraged in filenames,
due to their special meaning in Linux.

Do not use the ` `Â (space) symbol in filenames.
Instead, use the `_` (underscore) or `-` (dash) symbols.

For instance, do not use `my file.txt`; use `my_file.txt` instead.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Quoting filenames that contain space can sometimes help the shell to recognise the full filename (e.g., 'my file.txt'). However, it is just best to avoid the issue altogether." />}}

Avoid using the following special symbols as well:

- `%` (percentage)
- `$` (dollar sign)
- `Â£` (pound)
- `"` (double quotation mark)
- `'` (single quotation mark)
- `/` (forward slash)
- `\` (back slash)
- `|` (pipe)
- `=` (equal sign)
