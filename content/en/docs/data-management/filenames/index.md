## Case-sensitivity

In Linux, file names are case-sensitive.

In the example below, a series of distinct files stored in the same directory
differ only by the case-sensitivity of their filenames.

![Example of filenames that differ only by case-sensitive characters](case-sensitive.png)

Exclusively using lowercase characters generally makes thigs easier and less confusing
to remember.

## Unicity within directories

File names must be unique within each directory.

Bearing in mind the case-sensitivity of filenames described above,
all filenames within a given directory must be distinct.

For instance, using the `>` (greater than) symbol to redirect a stream
to a filename that already exists will overwrite that file
(i.e., it will not create another
file with the same name).

For instance, the code below will either:

- Create the file `file.txt` if it does not exist (and add `Hello` as its contents).
- Overwrite the contents of the file if it already exists.

```bash
echo "Hello" > file.txt
```

## Symbols allowed in filenames

Filenames can included a limited set of characters, including:

- Uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Digits.
- `-` (dash), `_` (underscore).

## Symbols to avoid in filenames

Some characters are not allowed or strongly discouraged in filenames,
due to their special meaning in Linux.

Do not use the ` `Â (space) symbol in filenames.
Instead, use the `_` (underscore) or `-` (dash) symbols.

For instance, do not use `my file.txt`; use `my_file.txt` instead.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Quoting filenames that contain space can sometimes help the shell to recognise the full filename (e.g., 'my file.txt'). However, it is just best to avoid the issue altogether." />}}

Avoid using the following special symbols as well:

- `%` (percentage)
- `$` (dollar sign)
- `Â£` (pound)
- `"` (double quotation mark)
- `'` (single quotation mark)
- `/` (forward slash)
- `\` (back slash)
- `|` (pipe)
- `=` (equal sign)

## Readability

Use distinctive, human-readable names that give an indication of the content.

Follow a consistent pattern that is both user-friendly to read
and machine-friendly to process (e.g. `sample1-replicate1-read1.fastq.gz`).

Make use of suffixes to identify file formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.sh`).

## Directory structure

Put each project in its own directory, named after the project.

Organise files into directory structures that follow a consistent pattern.

For instance:

```txt
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fastq/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample1.fastq.gz
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sample2.fastq.gz
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ annotations/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ genome.gtf.gz
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ sample_metadata.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ code/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hisat2.sh
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ featurecounts.sh
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ notebooks/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ differential_expression.R
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ pathway_analysis.R
â”œâ”€â”€ results/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample1.bam
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample2.bam
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ read_counts.tsv
â””â”€â”€ README.txt
```

Sub-directories are commonly created for:

- Raw sequencing data (e.g., FASTQ files).
- Publicly available data sets (e.g., [Gene Expression Omnibus - NCBI][ncbi-geo]).
- Reference genome, index, and annotations (e.g., [Ensembl FTP][ensembl-ftp]).
- Analysis code (e.g., scripts, notebooks, pipelines).
- Analysis output files (e.g., tables, plots, reports).
