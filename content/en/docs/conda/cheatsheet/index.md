## Install a specific package version

To install a specific version of a package, add the `=` symbol, followed by the
specific version number.

For instance:

```bash
mamba install pysam=0.19.1
```

Use `mamba search` to identify the the list of versions available for a given package.

```bash
mamba search pysam
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The search returns package versions in alphanumeric order, meaning that the most recent versions will be present at the end of the output." />}}

## Dry-run

For several commands, the `--dry-run` option can be used to only display what would have been done,
without actually doing anything.
This can be particularly helpful to safely assess the impact of any command that is likely to 
significantly alter the environment.

For instance:

```
mamba install pysam --dry-run
```
