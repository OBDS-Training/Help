## Download the installer

In a new Terminal application, log into the CCB cluster.

Download the latest Miniconda installer for Linux using the following command.

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

For reference, the URL to the installer file was obtained from the
[Latest Miniconda installer links][miniconda-installers-latest].

## Run the installer

Use `bash` to execute the installer file.

```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/conda
```

The option `-b` runs the installer in 'batch' mode (without manual intervention).

The option `-p` specifies the installation path, the location where Conda will
be installed.
We recommend specifying `~/conda`, which will create a directory `conda` in your
home directory.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Some of the instructions below rely on this specific installation path. If you decide to change it, be sure to adapt the following instructions accordingly." />}}

Once the installation successfully completes, you may want to delete the installer
file.

```bash
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

## Test the installation

Before going further, we recommend testing that the new installation of Conda works
as expected.

First, the `source` command executes a script that makes Conda discoverable in the
Bash environment of your Terminal application.
This command is not expected to return any information in the Terminal.

Then, the `conda` command is used to activate the `base` environment that was
created during the installation process.
Again, this command is not expected to return any information in the Terminal.
However, after that command completes, the prefix `(base)` should be visible
at the start of the prompt (see screenshot below).

```bash
source ~/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate base
```

The `which` command can also be used to verify that the `conda` command
is found on the `PATH`, at the expected location (see screenshot below).

```bash
which conda
```

## Deactivate the environment

Before going further, we recommend deactivating the `base` environment.

To do so, the `conda` command is used with the `deactivate` sub-command.

```bash
conda deactivate
```

<!-- ![](test-interactively.png) -->

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Deactivating at this point will allow us to test a new shortcut that we set up in the next section." />}}

## Create a shortcut

Open the `~/.bashrc` file and add the following lines.

```bash
# Create an alias to activate the Conda base environment
alias conda_activate_base='source ~/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate base'
```

## Test the shortcut

First, we use the `source` command to execute the commands in `~/.bashrc` file,
including the `alias` command that defines the new shortcut.

Then, we test the newly defined alias by typing its name.
This shortcut should have the same effect as typing the full command defined in the alias,
activating the `base` Conda environment, and adding the `(base)` prefix to the prompt
(see screenshot below).

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
conda_activate_base
```
