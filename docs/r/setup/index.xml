These are available via the R-cbrg module.
Basic usage # If you just want to get up and running with set of commonly used bioinformatics packages curated by the CCB team, you can do so with a single command:

R must be installed before the RStudio IDE, so that the RStudio IDE detects at least one version of R. Install R # Download the installer file # In your web browser, navigate to https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/.
On the web page, click on the link &amp;lsquo;Download R-x.x.x for Windows&amp;rsquo; (where x.x.x is the latest version of R available for Windows).</description></item><item><title>Install Bioconductor</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/r/setup/bioconductor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/r/setup/bioconductor/</guid><description>Motivation # The Bioconductor project provides many R packages focused on the analysis of biological assays.
Install BiocManager # Instructions are available on the main Bioconductor website.
Briefly, first launch RStudio.
Then, run the following command in the R console:
if (!require(&amp;quot;BiocManager&amp;quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&amp;quot;BiocManager&amp;quot;) RTools # When running the command above, you may be prompted with the following warning message:
In which case, please navigate to https://cran.</description></item></channel></rss>
