Most commonly, the FileZilla Client is used to transfer files between a local computer &amp;ndash; where the FileZilla Client is installed &amp;ndash; and a remote computer (e.g., the CCB cluster).
While connected to a remote computer, the main window of the FileZilla typically looks as follows:

For instance:
FTP Download - Ensembl → ArrayExpress - EMBL-EBI → ENA Browser - European Nucleotide Archive - EMBL-EBI → Gene Expression Omnibus - NCBI → Home - SRA - NCBI → It is often necessary to download data files from those public repositories onto the CCB cluster before they can be used by programs running on the CCB cluster.</description></item></channel></rss>
