However, the resources that may be used at any point in time are limited by the total amount of resources available on the CCB cluster.
To ensure fair access to all users, the CCB cluster uses the Slurm workload manager. Users are required to submit their work as job scripts that describe the commands they wish to execute, and the amount of resources that they wish to grant to those commands during their execution.</description></item><item><title>Slurm commands</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/slurm/commands/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/slurm/commands/</guid><description>Motivation # Once logged into the CCB cluster, a number of Slurm commands can be used to query resources available and the current workload.
In this page, we provide a cheatsheet of the most commonly used commands along with a brief description of their purpose and advice on best practices.
Partitions # Summary information about partitions (i.e., job queues) can be accessed as follows.
sinfo Example output for the `sinfo` command.</description></item></channel></rss>
