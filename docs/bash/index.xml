In those new sessions, you may find yourself repetitively typing the same set of commands to set up the environment of that session before you are able to work.
The file ~/.bashrc is a Shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. As such, this file is often edited to include commands that users wish to execute every time they log in, without the need to explicitly type them every time.</description></item></channel></rss>
