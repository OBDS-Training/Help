A process is a running instance of a program.
Every process has a process identifier (often abbreviated pid).
During execution, a process changes between states depending on its environment and circumstances. The most common states are:
Running &amp;ndash; The process is actively running on the system. Waiting &amp;ndash; The process is waiting for an event to occur or for a system resource.</description></item><item><title>Monitor processes</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/processes/monitor-processes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/processes/monitor-processes/</guid><description>Snapshot current processes # The ps command can be used to report a snapshot of the current processes.
ps The output of the ps command will always include at least two entries:
The bash process that is used to run the current Bash session. The ps process itself, which is being being executed to snapshot currently running processes. Then, any other process that is currently running will be reported by the ps command.</description></item><item><title>Monitor disk usage</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/processes/disk-usage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/processes/disk-usage/</guid><description>Why monitoring disk usage? # CCB accounts are subject to charging as a result of the costs associated with the necessary storage and computing facilities.
To ensure fair usage of the shared disk resources, the CCB cluster enforces quotas that restrict the amount of disk space that users may utilise to store files for their various projects.
Users are encouraged to regularly check their disk usage, to manage their files and remain within their disk usage quota or request an increase to their quota (at an additional cost).</description></item><item><title>Resilience to loss of connection</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/processes/hangup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/processes/hangup/</guid><description>What happens when the connection is lost? # The connection to a Bash session on the CCB cluster may be lost for a number of reasons:
Loss of internet connection anywhere between your computer and the CCB cluster. Power loss causing an unexpected outage of CCB systems. Loss of connection to the University VPN (if applicable). When the connection to a Bash session is lost, the HUP (hangup) signal is sent to the Bash session.</description></item></channel></rss>
