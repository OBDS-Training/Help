For instance, a few common scenarios that use streams:
passing the contents &amp;ndash; not the name ! &amp;ndash; of a file as the input to a command passing the output of a command as the input to another command writing the output of a command to a (new or existing) file Some standard streams are commonly referred to in Linux:</description></item><item><title>The Linux pipe</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/pipes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/pipes/</guid><description>What is the Linux pipe? # The Linux philosophy is that one tool should only perform only one task, in a way that complex workflows may be broken down into smaller tasks that can be resolved by combining multiple tools.
The Linux pipe is represented by the symbol | and provides a tool connecting the standard output of one command to the standard input of another command.
Using the Linux pipe # For instance, the standard output of a command command1 can be passed to the standard input of a command command2 using the sytax command1 | command2.</description></item><item><title>Combine commands</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/combine-commands/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/combine-commands/</guid><description>Successive commands # Generally, successive commands are executed in separate statements.
For instance:
echo &amp;quot;Some text&amp;quot; echo &amp;quot;Some more text&amp;quot; However, the symbol ; can be used to combine multiple commands in a single statement using the syntax command1; command2.
For instance:
echo &amp;quot;Some text&amp;quot;; echo &amp;quot;Some more text&amp;quot; The statements are executed in order, from left to right.
While there is no major preference toward either syntax, a noticeable difference between the two approaches is that:</description></item><item><title>Compress and decompress files</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/compress/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/compress/</guid><description>Why compress files? # Raw data files and files created during analyses can be large (up to hundreds of GB).
Compressing files is an efficient way to save disk space.
Compress using gzip # The gzip command can be used to compress files.
gzip file1.txt By default, the original file is removed, and the file extension .gz is added to the original file name, to form the name of the new compressed file.</description></item><item><title>Filter and sort file contents</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/filter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/filter/</guid><description>Print lines matching a pattern # The grep command can be used to search files and print only lines that match a given pattern.
The pattern to search for must be given as a Regular expression â†’. The regular expression does not always need to include special wildcard characters; it can be as simple as the exact sequence of characters to search for.
The example below illustrates how the lines of the file file.</description></item><item><title>Searching for files</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/find/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/find/</guid><description>Motivation # In the Terminal application, programmatically searching for files or directories that match certain conditions (e.g., naming pattern) is a powerful way to apply given commands to groups of related files in a systematic way.
The find command can be used to search for files and/or directories that match certain conditions.
In particular:
The first argument to the find command is typically the path to the directory in which to perform the search.</description></item><item><title>Loop over items and files</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/loops/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/working/loops/</guid><description>Motivation # When repeatedly executing the same set of commands on a series of inputs, loops can be used to:
Define a set of input. Define a set of commands. Execute the set of commands on the set of inputs. The for loop # The for loop takes a list of inputs, and iterates over each item in the list, repeating a set of commands &amp;ndash; once for each input &amp;ndash; until all inputs are processed.</description></item></channel></rss>
