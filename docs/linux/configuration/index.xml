In those new sessions, you may find yourself repetitively typing the same set of commands to set up the environment of that session before you are able to work.
The file ~/.bashrc is a Shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively.</description></item><item><title>Bash environment variables</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/configuration/environment-variables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/configuration/environment-variables/</guid><description>Motivation # Once logged into the CCB cluster, a number of environment variables are set in the Bash session.
Some environment variables are identical for all users on the cluster, other are derived from the username, and users can also set environment variables themselves. Many programs require certain environment variables to be set for their good functioning.
In this page, we describe some of the built-in environment variables, with a brief description of their purpose and advice on best practices.</description></item><item><title>Advanced configuration</title><link>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/configuration/advanced/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://obds-training.github.io/Help/docs/linux/configuration/advanced/</guid><description>.bashrc # Alternative login shells # The ~/.bashrc file is a script that is only read by the Bash login shell. The CCB cluster using Bash, this login shell should be the only one that you edit and worry about.
You may come across mention of other login shells (e.g., ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile).
Those other files perform a task similar to the ~/.bashrc file, albeit with subtle differences with respect to the order and the environment in which they are executed.</description></item></channel></rss>
