ðŸ‘‰ You are encouraged to change your initial password on your first connection. More on that after we get you logged into the CCB cluster for the first time. To log into a login node, open a Terminal on your personal computer and use the ssh command, combining your username, the @ symbol, and the name of the login node that you wish to log into.</description></item><item><title>Change your password</title><link>https://kevinrue.github.io/wimm_ccb_doks/docs/ssh/change-password/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevinrue.github.io/wimm_ccb_doks/docs/ssh/change-password/</guid><description>Motivation # The initial randomly generated password that you received by email is at risk of being stolen and misused if your email account were ever hacked. Separately, the randomness of the password makes it very difficult to remember and type from memory.
It is highly recommended to change that initial password on your first connection to the CCB cluster. To do so, in a Terminal logged in the CCB cluster, type the command passwd and press the Return key, as follows:</description></item><item><title>Set up an SSH key pair</title><link>https://kevinrue.github.io/wimm_ccb_doks/docs/ssh/ssh-key-pair/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevinrue.github.io/wimm_ccb_doks/docs/ssh/ssh-key-pair/</guid><description>Motivation # An SSH key pair can be used as an additional layer of security to connect to your account on the CCB HPC cluster. Instead of typing your username and password, it is possible to log into your account on the CCB cluster using a pair of files; one file on your personal computer (the &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; key), one file on the CCB cluster (the &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; key). Together, those two files identify your personal computer and the cluster to each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
